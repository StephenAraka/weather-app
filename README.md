## Demo Android APK
I have included a demo of the application on [this like here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Neg5g2G_CRgInqmPXylZOckpvj2CJJn8/view?usp=drive_link). Feel free to download it and run it on any android phone.

## Conventions  
- **Language**: TypeScript for static typing with type safety and improved developer experience and formatted using Prettier. 
    ```

## Architecture and General Considerations  

### Architecture  
- **State Management**: Managed using **React Query** for asynchronous data fetching and caching.  
- **UI Framework**: Built with **React Native**, styled using **Tailwind CSS** for rapid development.  
- **Backend Integration**: Weather data fetched from [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/) and location services integrated via [GeoDB Cities API](https://rapidapi.com/wirefreethought/api/geodb-cities).  

### General Considerations  
1. **Offline Mode**: Caching with React Query ensures weather data remains accessible even offline.  
2. **Responsiveness**: Flexible layout with Tailwind ensures a seamless experience across devices.

## Third-Party Libraries  

| Library                | Purpose                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **React Native**        | Core framework for building cross-platform mobile apps.               |
| **React Query**         | Handles API calls, caching, and data synchronization.                 |
| **Axios**               | Simplifies HTTP requests with a clean syntax.                         |
| **React Navigation**    | Provides navigation and routing for the app.                         |
| **Tailwind CSS**        | Utility-first CSS framework for responsive designs.                   |
| **GeoDB Cities API**    | Retrieves city information for search functionality.                  |
| **OpenWeatherMap API**  | Fetches weather data and 5-day forecasts.                             |
| **Prettier**            | Code formatting to ensure consistent style.                          |
| **ESLint**              | Static analysis to catch errors and enforce code quality.             |

## Building the Project  

### Prerequisites  
1. **Node.js** (v16 or later)  
2. **Expo CLI** installed globally:  
   ```bash
   npm install -g expo-cli


### Steps to Build  
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/StephenAraka/weather-app.git
   cd weather-app
```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Add your API keys to .env file:
   ```bash
   OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_key
   GEODB_API_KEY=your_geodb_key
   ```

4. Start the project:
   ```bash
   expo start
   ```
5. Test the app on a simulator or a physical device by scanning the QR code.


## Additional Notes
#### 1. Optimizations:

- **Debouncing**: Search input is debounced to reduce API calls while typing.

#### 2. Testing:
   - Manual testing for all screens and workflows.
   - Future plans to integrate Jest for unit tests and Cypress for end-to-end tests.

#### 3. Future Enhancements:

- **Dark Mode**: Toggle theme based on user preferences, I had also considered using dark mode for locations where the time is already night time.
- **Weather Alerts**: Notify users of severe weather conditions.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Expand the app’s usability for global users.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages for network issues or invalid inputs.
- **Accessibility**: Adhering to WCAG guidelines for text contrast and touch targets.
- **Scalability**: Modular architecture allows easy addition of new features.
